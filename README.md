FHIR Population Analytics Pipeline

This project provides a Python-based pipeline for ingesting, normalizing, and analyzing synthetic ELGA FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data. The entire analysis is designed to be run in a Google Colab notebook, allowing for a zero-configuration, browser-based environment.

The primary goal is to demonstrate a practical workflow for transforming complex, nested FHIR bundles into a flat, tabular format suitable for population-level analytics, cohort filtering, and data visualization.
Features

    FHIR Data Ingestion: Parses synthetic Patient, Observation, and Medication FHIR bundles in JSON format.

    Data Normalization: Flattens the nested FHIR resources into clean, easy-to-use Pandas DataFrames.

    Cohort Analysis: Implements functions to filter patient populations based on criteria like age, gender, and date ranges.

    Statistical Computation: Calculates key metrics such as lab value distributions and medication adherence rates.

    Data Visualization: Generates insightful charts (histograms, bar plots, time-series) using Matplotlib.

    Unit Testing: Includes a suite of pytest unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of all data transformations.

Technology Stack

    Python 3

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    Matplotlib: For data visualization.

    fhir.resources: For parsing and validating FHIR data models.

    pytest: For unit testing the data pipeline.

    Google Colab: For the interactive development environment.

How to Use

    Open in Colab: Click the "Open In Colab" badge at the top of this README to open the notebook directly in your browser.

    Run the Cells: Execute the cells in the notebook from top to bottom by pressing Shift + Enter.

    View the Outputs: The notebook will process the sample data, perform the analysis, and display the resulting tables and visualizations.

Project Structure

The FHIR_Analytics_Pipeline.ipynb notebook is organized into the following sections:

    Setup & Installation: Installs all necessary libraries and handles imports.

    Data Ingestion: Loads the synthetic Patient, Observation, and Medication FHIR bundles.

    Data Transformation: Flattens the FHIR resources into three distinct Pandas DataFrames.

    Data Merging & Enrichment: Combines the DataFrames to create a unified analytical dataset.

    Analytics & Cohort Filtering: Applies filters and computes statistics on the data.

    Visualizations: Renders charts to visualize the results of the analysis.

    Unit Tests: Contains pytest cells to validate the pipeline's functions.
